# Ebay_like_project
Instructions: 

"Thursday Lap 1 - Consolidation Exercise
Task: Implement a simple listing service (think ebay but really simple).
Set up your project (git/npm etc)
Folder structure
Homepage to have a form to enter the details of the items you wish to sell
Click a button on this page to submit the form
Send the form data to a new page that displays an example mock-up of your newly created listing to sell you item.
Create a good readme to document how you got there.
Extra credit/bonus kudos/optional extra/crisp high five - have a back button on the mock-up to go back to the original form to edit details. You may really have to think about this one as to how data is passed about!!
You will have a live code review with Ines/Dom on Friday to talk through your code and have a q&a about you thought process and approach.
Good luck & donâ€™t forget to look at documentation and other resources!"
